::question{:type="questionType"}
In the code snippet below, the parent route is missing a 'component' option. It only registers a path and children options. What role does the parent route play in this configuration?

<br />

```js
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/admin',
    children: [
      { path: '', component: AdminOverview },
      { path: 'users', component: AdminUserList },
      { path: 'users/:id', component: AdminUserDetails },
    ], 
  },
]
```

**Explanation: The parent route only adds a path prefix to a set of routes without needing to introduce a shared parent component.**

<br />

Starting from Vue router 4.1, a parent route can be used to add a path prefix to a set of routes without needing to introduce a shared parent component. In this example, visiting /admin will load the AdminOverview component. Visiting /admin/users will load the AdminUserList component. Visiting /admin/users/10 will load the AdminUserDetails component. But there is no shared parent component for all these routes.
