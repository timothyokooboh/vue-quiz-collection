**Explanation: if you allow unsanitized, user-provided content to be executed (as either HTML, JavaScript, or even CSS), you might open yourself up to attacks.**

<br />

Libraries like [DOMPurify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify) can help sanitize HTML content before rendering it with v-html. However, sanitization should also be done server-side to ensure maximum security.
