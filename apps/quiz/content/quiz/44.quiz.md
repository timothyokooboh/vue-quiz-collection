::question{:type="questionType"}
When a user visits /users/list or /people, how can you maintain the URL but match the /users route and serve the component that is associated with the /users route?

**Explanation: { path: '/users', alias: ['/users/list', '/people'] } creates aliases for the /users route.**

<br />

This is a concept called aliasing. This means that when a user visits /users/list or /people, the /users route will be matched and the component associated with the /users route will be served. However, the URL will still be /users/list or /people.

<br />

```js
const routes = [{ path: '/users', component: UsersList, alias: ['/users/list', '/people'] }]
```
