What is the significance of $forceUpdate()?

::

::explanation{:type="explanationType"}

**Explanation: $forceUpdate() is a method that can be called on a Vue component instance to force it to re-render.**

<br />
This can be useful in certain rare situations where the component's state or props have changed, but the component did not automatically re-render as a result.
