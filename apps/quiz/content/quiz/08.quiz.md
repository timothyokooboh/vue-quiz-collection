Which of these best defines async components?

**Components that are loaded when they are needed, rather than at initial application load.**

<br />

Aysnc components help improve application performance by splitting the application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This is particularly useful for large applications where loading all components upfront can lead to longer initial load times.

<br />

```js
<script setup>
const Modal = defineAsyncComponent(() =>
  import('./Modal.vue')
);
</script>

<template>
  <Modal v-if="isModalOpen" />
</template>
```

Use defineAsyncComponent to create components that load on demand, reducing initial bundle size and improving performance.

#code

```js
const Modal = defineAsyncComponent(() =>
  import('./Modal.vue')
);
```
