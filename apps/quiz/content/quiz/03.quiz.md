::question{:type="questionType"}
In the following code, what is the implication of setting the deep option to 2?

<br />

```js
const user = ref({
  name: "John doe",
  location: {
    country: {
      name: "Nigeria",
      region: "South-South",
    },
  },
});

watch(
  user,
  () => {
    console.log("user object has changed");
  },
  {
    deep: 2,
  },
);
```

**In Vue 3.5+, the deep option can also be a number indicating the max traversal depth - i.e. how many levels should Vue traverse an object's nested properties.**

<br>

Prior to Vue 3.5, deep was a boolean that simply turned on/off deep watching. With deep set to 2, Vue will observe changes to properties up to two levels deep within the user object. Changes to properties nested deeper than two levels will not trigger the watcher.

<br>

```js
// Properties at level 1 will trigger the watcher
user.value.name = "Jane doe";
user.value.location = { country: { name: "Ghana", region: "Greater Accra" } };

// Properties at level 2 will also trigger the watcher
user.value.location.country = { name: "Kenya", region: "Nairobi" };

// Properties from level 3 will NOT trigger the watcher
user.value.location.country.name = "France";
user.value.location.country.region = "Nairobi";
```

#text

In Vue 3.5+, the deep option in watchers can be a number to specify the maximum traversal depth for nested properties, limiting how deep changes are observed.

#code

```js
watch(
  user,
  () => {
    console.log("user object has changed");
  },
  {
    deep: 2, // Only watches up to 2 levels deep
  },
);
```
