::question{:type="questionType"}
This code pattern is quite common but it creates tight coupling between a component and the route. In this example, the User component needs to be used on routes that have an ID parameter. How can you decouple the component from the route?

<br />

```js
<template>
  <div>
    User {{ $route.params.id }}
  </div>
</template>
```

**Explanation: Configuring the route to pass the id param as a prop by setting props true, decouples the component from the route.**

<br />

This way, the component can be used as a regular component, even on routes that don't have an ID parameter.

<br />

```js
const routes = [
  { path: '/user/:id', component: User, props: true }
]
```

<br />

```js
// User.vue
<script setup>
defineProps({
  id: String
})
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    User {{ id }}
  </div>
</template>
```
