What is the first argument passed to the callback function of watchEffect?

})
```

**Explanation: The first argument passed to the callback function of watchEffect is a function to cleanup side effects.**

<br />

The function is called just before the watchEffect is executed again. Hence it is a good place to clean up side effects such as cancelling network requests or clearing timers.
