::question{:type="questionType"}
Why won’t the following code correctly watch changes to obj.count?

<br />

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 });

watch(obj.count, (count) => {
  console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);
});
```

**Explanation: The first argument of watch must be a reactive source such as a ref, computed property, reactive object, or a getter function.**

<br>

In the code above, obj.count is just a primitive value (number) and not a reactive source. To correctly watch changes to obj.count, you can either pass a getter function that returns obj.count or watch the entire reactive object obj.

<br>

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 });

// this won't work because we are passing a number to watch()
watch(obj.count, (count) => {
  console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);
});

// instead, use a getter:
watch(
  () => obj.count,
  (count) => {
    console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);
  },
);
```

#text

The watch function requires a reactive source as its first argument, such as a ref, computed property, reactive object, or getter function. Passing a primitive value directly won't work.

#code

```js
const obj = reactive({ count: 0 });

// Wrong: passing a primitive value
watch(obj.count, (count) => {
  console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);
});

// Correct: use a getter function
watch(() => obj.count, (count) => {
  console.log(`Count is: ${count}`);
});
```
