What is the first argument that can be passed to the callback function of computed?

<br />

```js
computed((??) => {
  // callback logic
})
```

**Explanation: The first argument that can be passed to the callback function of computed represents the old value.**

<br />

This is particularly useful for computed properties that return objects or arrays, as it allows you to compare the previous value with the new value and return the old value if nothing has changed. This helps to maintain computed property stability and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

<br />

```js
const computedObj = computed((oldValue) => {
  const newValue = {
    isEven: count.value % 2 === 0,
  };
  if (oldValue && oldValue.isEven === newValue.isEven) {
    return oldValue;
  }
  return newValue;
});
```
