::question{:type="questionType"}
The code snippet below does not navigate to /user/5. Why is that so?

<br />

```js
router.push({ path: '/user', params: { id: 5 } })
```

**Explanation: params cannot be used alongside path.**

<br />

params are ignored if a path is provided.  Instead, you need to provide the name of the route or manually specify the whole path with any parameter.

<br />

```js
router.push({ name: 'User', params: { id: 5 } })
```
Or

```js
router.push({ path: '/user/5' })
```
