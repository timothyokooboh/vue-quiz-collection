::question{:type="questionType"}
In the code snippet below, what does the span element represent?

<button type="submit">
  <slot>
    <span>Submit</span>
  </slot>
</button>

```

**Explanation: The span element represents the fallback content that will be displayed if the parent component does not provide any slot content.**

<br />

When using the `SubmitButton` component without any slot content, the button will display "Submit" as its label.

<br />

```js
// Renders <button type="submit">Submit</button>
<SubmitButton />
```
