::question{:type="questionType"}
By default, route paths match routes with or without a trailing slash. Hence, /users will match /users and /users/. Which route option makes route paths to not match routes with a trailing slash?

::

::explanation{:type="explanationType"}

**{ path: '/users', strict: true } makes route paths to not match routes with a trailing slash.**

<br />
This means that /users will match /users but will not match /users/.

```js
const routes = [
  { path: '/users', strict: true },
]
```

#text

Set strict: true on routes to enforce exact path matching, preventing matches with trailing slashes.

#code

```js
const routes = [
  { path: '/users', strict: true },
]
```
